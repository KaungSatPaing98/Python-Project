# CP1404 Assignment 2: Travel Tracker 2.0 by Kaung Sat Paing

_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own name/details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
The entire project take 15 days. The first one day I take the time for understood the requirement of assignment. The rest day, I take 5 to 7 hours to made coding  and GUI interface.

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
I am the most satisfied the Classes creating part.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
I am least satisfied with GUI interface. For me is very difficult part. Some of the function is not look like the class function. Finally I can handel with this problem.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
I want to work well in GUI part. Because I like to creating the software for mobile application. If I got a chance next time I will be challence on this.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
If want to do improved next time such as: Planning and organization: Having a well-defined project plan and clear objectives can improve the overall process. This includes setting realistic timelines, allocating resources effectively. Learn and apply best practices for branching, merging, and commit messages to ensure a smooth  coding process.

Testing and debugging: Incorporate testing into my coding process by writing unit tests and performing regular test runs. Automated testing frameworks can help catch bugs and ensure code correctness. Additionally, use debugging tools and techniques to troubleshoot and resolve issues efficiently.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
The most helping part is lecture video and practical. For GUI interface is, I learn some github code resources.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
For me comes with various challenges, including syntax errors, debugging, list comprehension. These obstacles can be overcome by practice daily, reviewing code thoroughly, employing effective debugging techniques, utilizing available resources and documentation.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
Using classes in Python has greatly improved my code organization and reusability. By encapsulating data and related functions within classes, I achieved a modular and structured design. Classes allowed me to create objects with their own attributes and behaviors, making the code more intuitive and readable. In addition, classes enabled me to implement inheritance and polymorphism, promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy. Overall, classes enhanced the clarity, flexibility, and maintainability of my code.
